           INSTALLING PARADOX ON A DEC PATHWORKS NETWORK
           ---------------------------------------------

This file contains instructions for installing Paradox on a DEC Pathworks
network. These instructions were verified using Pathworks, version 4.1a, on
a Dell 486P/33.

1. ASSUMPTIONS
--------------

These instructions assume the following about your Pathworks installation:

- You use DEC Pathworks version 4.1a or higher.

- Every network user has a home directory.

- Your network has a shared applications directory named APPS.

- You perform all installation and configuration operations from a
  DOS-based workstation.


2. INSTALLATION STEPS
---------------------

1)  Boot your 100%-compatible PC computer with DEC Pathworks configuration.

2)  Enter the SETHOST program to access your VAX by typing

    SETHOST nodename
    
    (where "nodename" is the name of your VAX Pathworks Server)

3)  Log on to Node as SYSTEM.

4)  Enter PCSA_MANAGER by typing

    PCSA

5)  Add a file service to the node for system files by typing

    PCSA_MANAGER > ADD SERVICE/DIRECTORY PARADOX/ROOT=diskname:[PARADOX]

    where "diskname" is an actual VAX disk name. This creates the specified
    directory and the VAX service name (PARADOX).

6)  Grant rights to the new PARADOX service.

    a. Grant user SYSTEM read/write/create rights to the PARADOX service
       by typing

       PCSA_MANAGER > GRANT SYSTEM PARADOX/ACCESS=(R,W,C)

    b. Grant group PUBLIC (and/or other allowed groups) read-only rights to
       the PARADOX service by typing

       PCSA_MANAGER > GRANT/GROUP PUBLIC PARADOX/ACCESS=R

       If you want to limit Paradox access to a single user or to a 
       group other than PUBLIC, replace PUBLIC with the appropriate
       VAX USERNAME.

7)  Add a file service to the node for data files by typing

    PCSA_MANAGER > ADD SERVICE/DIRECTORY PDOXDATA/ROOT=diskname:[PDOXDATA]

    where "diskname" is an actual VAX disk name. This creates the specified
    directory and the VAX service name (PDOXDATA).

8)  Grant access rights to the new PDOXDATA service.

    a. Grant user SYSTEM read/write/create rights to the new PDOXDATA service
       by typing

       PCSA_MANAGER > GRANT SYSTEM PDOXDATA/ACCESS=(R,W,C)

       This gives user SYSTEM read/write/create rights to the PDOXDATA service.

    b. Grant the group PUBLIC (and/or other allowed groups) access rights
       to the new PDOXDATA service by typing

       PCSA_MANAGER > GRANT/GROUP PUBLIC PDOXDATA/ACCESS=(R,W,C)

       If you want to limit Paradox access to a single user or to a 
       group other than PUBLIC, replace PUBLIC with the appropriate
       VAX USERNAME.

9)  View the new services and the rights associated with them.

    a. To view available services, type

       PCSA_MANAGER > SHOW FILE SERVICES/REGISTER

    b. To view available rights, type

       PCSA_MANAGER > SHOW FILE SERVICES/AUTHORIZE

10) Change or create either the AUTOUSER.BAT or STARTUP.BAT file in each
    user's boot directory.

    a. From the VAX, edit AUTOUSER.BAT.

       - Select an unused logical drive letter for the PARADOX service and
         add the following line to the file:

         USE F: \\nodename\\PARADOX

         (where "F:" is the logical drive and "nodename" is the VAX node).

       - Select an unused logical drive letter for the PDOXDATA service and
         add the following line to the file:

         USE G: \\nodename\\PDOXDATA

         (where "G:" is the logical drive and "nodename" is the VAX node).


    b. From DOS, edit STARTUP.BAT.

       - Select an unused logical drive letter for the PARADOX service and
         add the following line to the file:

         USE F: \\nodename\\PARADOX

         (where "F:" is the logical drive and "nodename" is the VAX node).

       - Select an unused logical drive letter for the PDOXDATA service and
         add the following line to the file:

         USE G: \\nodename\\PDOXDATA

         (where "G:" is the logical drive and "nodename" is the VAX node).

11) Log out of the SETHOST program and return to DOS.

12) Attach the logical drives from user SYSTEM. When prompted, type the
    Username SYSTEM, and then enter the password:

    C> USE F: \\nodename\\PARADOX *
    Username: (Enter SYSTEM)
    Password: (Enter the SYSTEM password)
    
    C> USE G: \\nodename\\PDOXDATA *
    Username: (Enter SYSTEM)
    Password: (Enter the SYSTEM password)

    PARADOX is the system file service; PDOXDATA is the shared data
    service.

13) Change to the new system drive. Type

    F:

14) Install the Paradox system files and optional software on the new file
    service. Follow the instructions in NETWORK.TXT (found on your Paradox
    installation disks). The Paradox INSTALL program copies your Paradox
    system files and optional software from the program disks into the system
    files directory, PDOX45 on logical drive F.

15) Create or modify the CONFIG.SYS file of each workstation to set at least 
    the minimum number of buffers and files needed by Paradox:

    FILES=40
    BUFFERS=40

    A workstation's CONFIG.SYS file must be stored in the root directory of
    the workstation's hard disk (or on the boot disk if the workstation is
    started from a floppy disk). See NETWORK.TXT for details on CONFIG.SYS.

    NOTE: After editing the CONFIG.SYS file, you must reboot the workstation
    before you can run Paradox. To reboot, press [Ctrl][Alt][Del].

16) Create a private directory for each user. The private directory must be
    either a network read/write directory or a directory on a local hard
    disk. For information, see "Linking Users and Setting User Paths" later
    in this file. For information about private directories, see NETWORK.TXT.

    Normally, each user on a Pathworks network has a home directory (and
    associated subdirectories), which can be used for Paradox tables.

    In most cases, a single user has rights to a particular home directory.
    Only that user can use Paradox tables stored in his or her home
    directory. Other directories on the network may grant rights to more than
    one person. Paradox tables stored in these multiuser directories can be
    accessed by anyone who has rights to them. These are called shared
    directories.

17) Link each user to the Paradox system files directory, PDOX45. For
    information, see "Linking Users and Setting User Paths" later in this
    file.

18) Link each user to the directory containing PDOXUSRS.NET, PDOXDATA. For
    information, see "Linking Users and Setting User Paths" later in this
    file.

19) Change each Paradox user's path to search for the user's private
    directory and the Paradox system files directory, IN THAT ORDER. The
    user's private directory must precede all other Paradox-related
    directories in the path, since Paradox searches for PARADOX.CFG in the
    private directory to determine the user's private directory and other
    default settings. See NETWORK.TXT for details about the PARADOX.CFG file.

    - Make sure no PARADOX.CFG files are in any of the network directories
      listed in a user's search path and then search the local private
      directory immediately after the last network directory. If you used a
      default PARADOX.CFG file in the PDOX45 directory as NETWORK.TXT
      explains, you will have to delete that file before users begin running
      Paradox.

    - Use the DOS PATH command to set up each user's search path. You must
      use this method if Paradox system files will be downloaded to a local
      hard disk as NETWORK.TXT describes.

20) Create PARADOX.CFG files for each user. See NETWORK.TXT for details.


3. LINKING USERS AND SETTING USER PATHS
---------------------------------------

You can establish the necessary links and paths for each workstation (steps
17, 18, and 19) in different ways. In theory, network users can enter them
manually from their keyboards when they want to use Paradox, but this isn't
recommended, because a mistake can cause problems for network Paradox users.
You should set up a system that automatically establishes the proper DOS
path for each user instead. You can use two methods:

- A login batch file that automatically sets up every user to run Paradox
  when he or she logs in to the network. Use this method for networks where
  Paradox is used frequently.

- A Paradox batch file that sets up the correct links and path when a user
  starts Paradox. Use this method for networks where Paradox is used
  infrequently.

To use a login batch file
-------------------------
- The user's private directory is either on the local hard disk (for example,
  C:\PDOX45) or on the user's network read/write directory (if there is no
  local hard disk), and the user's PARADOX.CFG file is stored in the private
  directory.

- No default PARADOX.CFG file is present in the PDOX45 directory on the file
  server.

- The workstation has a local hard disk, and therefore has a DOS path that
  includes the Paradox private directory, C:\PDOX45.

- Each user always has the file service, PDOXDATA, containing the network
  control file PDOXUSRS.NET, mapped to the same logical drive.

To use a Paradox batch file
---------------------------
Give the batch file an appropriate name, such as PDOX45.BAT, and store it in
a shared applications directory. The following batch file assumes that the
user's network read/write directory is \APPS\PDOX45 on the PDOXDATA file
service.

USE F: \\nodename\\PARADOX
USE G: \\nodename\\PDOXDATA
G:
CD \APPS\PDOX45
SET OLDPATH=%PATH%
SET PATH=G:\APPS\PDOX45;F:\PDOX45;%OLDPATH%
F:\PDOX45\PARADOX
SET PATH=%OLDPATH%
USE F:/D
USE G:/D

Here are descriptions of the individual lines:

- The first line maps the read-only PARADOX file service to logical drive F. If
  some other file service is already mapped to the drive letter you pick, the
  new USE command will fail.  You must choose an unused drive letter or
  disconnect the current service before the USE command will work correctly.

- The second line maps the PDOXDATA file service to logical drive G, assuming
  this service contains the directory with the PDOXUSRS.NET file and that G:\
  is what you specified as the location of this file when you installed
  Paradox.

- The third and fourth lines change the current directory to the user's
  read/write home directory where the databases are stored.
  
- The fifth line saves the current path before changing it.

- The sixth line adds the current user's personal directory and the
  directory containing the PDOXUSRS.NET file into the path. Note that the
  user directory is listed before the system directory so that the PARADOX.CFG
  file will be found first in the user's directory.
  
- The seventh line starts and runs Paradox.

- The eighth line resets the user's path to the value it had before
  Paradox was run.
  
- The ninth and tenth lines are invoked when the user exits Paradox; they
  delete the mapping for the PARADOX and the PDOXDATA file services,
  respectively, and make drives F and G available for other uses.
