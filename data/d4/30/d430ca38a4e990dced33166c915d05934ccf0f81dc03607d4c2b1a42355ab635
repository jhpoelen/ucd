              INSTALLING PARADOX ON AN IBM PC LAN NETWORK
              -------------------------------------------

This file contains instructions for installing Paradox on the IBM PC Local
Area Network (LAN). It also contains special instructions for installing
the extended version of PC LAN 1.31. These instructions were verified
using PC LAN 1.31 on a Compaq 386/25 using DOS 3.31 and DOS 4.0.

Because the PC LAN software runs on either the IBM Token Ring hardware/
software combination or the IBM PC Net hardware, PC LANs are often
called Token Ring networks.

1. ASSUMPTIONS
--------------

These instructions assume the following about your PC LAN installation:

- You use PC LAN version 1.12 or higher and DOS 3.1 or higher on PC Net
  hardware, or DOS 3.2 or higher with Token Ring hardware/software.

- Your network is configured as recommended in the IBM PC Local Area
  Network Program documentation.

- All shared applications' software is stored in subdirectories of the
  APPS directory.

- Each person who is going to use Paradox on the network has a private
  directory.

- You're familiar with the PC LAN commands NET SHARE and NET USE.

- You're installing Paradox on a dedicated server.

  NOTE: A computer running as a PC LAN server can be either dedicated (used
  only as a file server) or non-dedicated (also used as a workstation to run
  Paradox or other application programs). To ensure both good performance and
  maximum data integrity, use a dedicated server. If you must use a
  non-dedicated PC LAN server, be sure to read section 2.

- You perform all installation and configuration operations from a
  workstation.


2. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

Paradox requires at least 200K of conventional free memory to load. A
minimally configured PC LAN server has only 172K of free memory; thus, you
can't run Paradox from a PC LAN server.


3. INSTALLATION STEPS
---------------------

NOTE: PC LAN provides an Installation Aid for installing IBM-supplied
software. Since Paradox isn't supplied by IBM, you can't use the Installation
Aid to install Paradox.

1)  Create the Paradox system files directory, PDOX45, as a subdirectory of
    the shared applications directory APPS. From the server's DOS prompt and
    the root directory, type

    MD \APPS\PDOX45

2)  Give yourself, the network administrator, read/write/create rights to
    this directory but all other users read-only rights to it.

3)  Create a shared first-level directory, PDOXDATA, that will contain
    shared Paradox data and the network control file PDOXUSRS.NET.

    If you have more than one server, or if your server has more than one
    hard disk, your choice of which server disk drive to use for the
    PDOXDATA directory should depend on how heavily Paradox will be used.
    Estimate the probable growth of your shared data and pick a drive with
    enough available storage space.

    As your network users become familiar with Paradox , they will probably
    create new Paradox tables and applications. When in doubt, overestimate
    the amount of space you'll need.

    a. Make the server's root directory your current directory. Type

       CD\

    b. Create the PDOXDATA directory. Type

       MD PDOXDATA.

4)  Give all users read/write/create rights to the PDOXDATA directory.

5)  Install the Paradox system files and optional software. Follow the
    instructions in NETWORK.TXT (found on your Paradox installation disks).
    The Paradox INSTALL program copies your Paradox system files and optional
    software from the program disks into the system files directory, PDOX45.

6)  Create or modify the CONFIG.SYS file of each workstation to set the
    number of buffers and files needed by Paradox :

    FILES=40
    BUFFERS=40

    A workstation's CONFIG.SYS file must be stored in the root directory of
    the workstation's hard disk (or on the boot disk if the workstation is
    started from a floppy disk). See NETWORK.TXT for details on CONFIG.SYS.

    NOTE: After editing the CONFIG.SYS file, you must reboot the workstation
    before you can run Paradox . To reboot, press [Ctrl][Alt][Del].

7)  Link each user to a private directory. The private directory must be
    either a network home directory or a private directory on a local hard
    disk. For information, see "Linking Users and Setting User Paths" later
    in this file. For information about private directories, see NETWORK.TXT.

8)  Set workstation net use by issuing NET SHARE commands on the server for:

    - the Paradox system files directory, PDOX45

    - the shared data directory containing the PDOXUSRS.NET file, PDOXDATA

      IMPORTANT: The logical drive you assign to this directory must match
      the drive you specified for the PDOXUSRS.NET file when you installed
      Paradox on the network. All Paradox users must always have this
      directory linked to the same logical drive.

    - the users' network home directories

    For information, see "Linking Users and Setting User Paths" later in this
    file.

9)  Change each Paradox user's path to search for the user's private
    directory and the Paradox system files directory, IN THAT ORDER. The
    user's private directory must precede all other Paradox -related
    directories in the path, since Paradox searches for PARADOX.CFG in the
    private directory to determine the user's private directory and other
    default settings. For information, see "Linking Users and Setting
    User Paths" later in this file.

10) Create PARADOX.CFG files. See NETWORK.TXT for details.


4. LINKING USERS AND SETTING USER PATHS
---------------------------------------

You can establish workstation NET USE commands and individual paths (steps 7,
8, and 9) in different ways. In theory, network users can enter them manually
from their keyboards when they want to use Paradox , but this isn't
recommended, because a mistake can cause problems for network Paradox users.
You should automatically make the correct NET USE commands and path available
to each user instead. You can use two methods:

- An AUTOEXEC.BAT file that automatically sets up every user to run Paradox 
  when he or she boots his or her machine. Use this method for networks where
  Paradox is used frequently.

- A Paradox batch file that issues the correct NET USE commands and defines
  the path when a user starts Paradox . Use this method for networks where
  Paradox is used infrequently.

To use an AUTOEXEC.BAT file
---------------------------
Include the necessary NET USE commands and path in each workstation's
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Insert the NET USE and PATH commands in each workstation's
AUTOEXEC.BAT file above the AUTOUSER line.

- If the workstation has a local hard disk, create a directory on the local
  hard disk named PDOXPRIV, which will contain the PARADOX.CFG file and be
  used by Paradox as the user's private directory.

- If the workstation has no local hard disk, users must use their network
  home directories as their private directories and to store the PARADOX.CFG
  file.

Assuming that the directory PDOX45 is a subdirectory of APPS on a workstation
with a local hard disk, insert the following lines in the workstation's
AUTOEXEC.BAT file above the AUTOUSER line:

NET USE K: \\COMPUTERNAME\APPS
NET USE H: \\COMPUTERNAME\PDOXDATA
PATH=C:\PDOXPRIV; K:\PDOX45; K:\

Here are descriptions of the individual lines:

- The first line links the network short name APPS (the shared applications
  directory) to the workstation's logical drive K. COMPUTERNAME" is the
  machine name of the server.

- The second line links the network short name PDOXDATA (the PDOXDATA
  directory that contains PDOXUSRS.NET) to drive H.

- The third line sets the correct path so the local hard disk private
  directory C:\PDOX45 (containing the PARADOX.CFG file) is searched before
  any other directories.

  You can also use this method for a single-user workstation without a local
  hard disk. For example, if this were Lincoln's workstation, the
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file would have these lines:

  NET USE E: \\COMPUTERNAME\LINCOLN
  NET USE K: \\COMPUTERNAME\APPS
  NET USE H: \\COMPUTERNAME\PDOXDATA
  PATH=E:\; K:\PDOX45; K:\

  The first line links the network short name LINCOLN to the workstation
  logical drive E. "COMPUTERNAME" is the server machine name.

  On the network server, a NET SHARE command links the short name LINCOLN to
  Lincoln's network home directory. Thus, this line in the batch file links
  Lincoln's network home directory on the server to logical drive E on the
  workstation. Lincoln will use his network home directory as his private
  directory.

- The fourth line sets the correct path with Lincoln's network home
  directory E, containing his PARADOX.CFG file, which is searched before any
  other directories.

To use a Paradox batch file
---------------------------
Create a special Paradox batch file called PDOX.BAT that is run when a user
starts Paradox . This batch file establishes the correct NET USE commands and
sets the correct path when Paradox is called. Use this method for workstations
without local hard disks that are used by more than one person.

Store this batch file in a directory already on everyone's search path, such
as the shared applications directory. Since everyone who uses Paradox will
run the same Paradox batch file, write the path so that Paradox finds the
correct PARADOX.CFG file for each user.

The following sample Paradox batch file makes these assumptions:

- Everyone who runs the batch file is already logged in to the network.

- A NET USE command has already linked the shared applications directory APPS
  to logical drive K. This could have been done from a workstation
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file or from a user login batch file.

- PDOX.BAT is stored in a subdirectory BATCH of the shared applications
  directory APPS, and APPS\BATCH is already on each user's path.

- The PDOX45 directory is a subdirectory of the shared applications directory
  APPS.

- Each user's network home directory is always linked with NET USE to his or
  her logical drive E. This can be done from the keyboard, from a workstation
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file, or from a user login batch file.

Here is the batch file. (If your network doesn't conform to the previous
assumptions, you might need to modify it.)

PATH>E:\SAVEPATH.BAT
NET USE H:\\COMPUTERNAME\PDOXDATA
PATH=C:\PDOX45;K:\PDOX45;K:\;K:\BATCH;
Paradox 
NET USE H:/D
COMMAND/C E:\SAVEPATH
DEL E:\SAVEPATH.BAT

Here are descriptions of the individual lines:

- The first line saves the user's current path as a separate batch file for
  later restoration. Save this batch file in the user's home directory, E:,
  so it won't be confused with anyone else's SAVEPATH.BAT.

- The second line links the network short name PDOXDATA (for the PDOXDATA
  directory that contains PDOXUSRS.NET) to drive H. "COMPUTERNAME" is the
  server machine name.

- The third line sets the correct path. The statement C:\PDOX45 refers to the
  local hard disk directory containing PARADOX.CFG. Since C:\PDOX45 comes
  before the other Paradox -related path statements, this ensures the correct
  PARADOX.CFG file is found.

- The statement K:\PDOX45 refers to the directory containing the Paradox 
  system files, which is a subdirectory of APPS. The statement K:\BATCH
  refers to the directory containing this batch file.

  NOTE: If some workstations on the network don't have hard disks, their
  users must use their network home directory as their private directory
  (containing a PARADOX.CFG file). In this case, the third line would be

  PATH = E:\; K:\PDOX45; K:\; K:\BATCH

  With this path, Paradox looks for the PARADOX.CFG file in the user's
  network home directory, E:.

- The fourth line starts Paradox .

- The fifth line is invoked when the user exits Paradox; it unlinks the
  PDOXDATA directory.

- The sixth line restores the user's original path by running the
  SAVEPATH.BAT batch file, which was created by the first line.

- The seventh line deletes the file SAVEPATH.BAT from the user's home
  directory.
