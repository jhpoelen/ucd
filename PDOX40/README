5. NOTES ON TUTILITY
--------------------

TUTILITY (for Table Utility) is a program designed to repair damaged
tables. The TUTILITY program that comes with Paradox 3.5 does not work
on Paradox 4.5 tables. If you have damaged Paradox 4.5 tables, use the
TUTILITY program included in your Paradox 4.5 system directory.

Paradox tables can be damaged by power failures, hardware failures, bad
network cards or connections, removing a floppy disk that Paradox is
accessing, or rebooting the system while Paradox is active in memory.
You should always make regular backups of your important data.

To start TUTILITY, exit Paradox, then type TUTILITY at the DOS
prompt and press Enter. Additional instructions and a description
of program options are provided in the TUTILITY.DOC file. Online
help is also available when you run the program. Command-line
help is available by typing TUTILITY -help.


6. Using TECHINFO
-----------------

Included in the Paradox system directory is an application,
TechInfo, that displays detailed information about your system.
To run it, choose Scripts|Play and enter TECHINFO (assuming the
current working directory is the system directory--usually
PDOX45). You can add TechInfo to the Utilities menu by adding the
following line to PARADOX.ADD:

UTILITY | TechInfo | Display System Information. | TECHINFO


7. Outer Join Queries in a Multi-user Environment
-------------------------------------------------

Outer join queries will always act as restart queries, regardless of the
Tools|Net|Changes setting.


8. Compression Utilities and Paradox Installation
-------------------------------------------------

Your system must have 6.5MB of disk space available to install
Paradox with all options included (6MB with no options included).
If you're using a compression utility to increase the amount of
available disk space on your system, you might need more
available space; drives enhanced with compression utilities can
provide only an estimate of available space.


9. Using ROUND()
----------------

In version 4.0, Paradox's ROUND() function was changed to use a
technique called Banker's rounding to round numbers. In standard
rounding, when a number lies exactly on the halfway point, it's
rounded up (for example, rounding 223.65 to one decimal place
results in 223.7). In Banker's rounding the number is rounded to
the nearest even number (for example, 223.65 is rounded to
223.6). Banker's rounding increases accuracy and helps prevent
rounding errors. For more information on Banker's rounding, see
TechFax number 1148.


10. Selection Precedence in File Prompts
----------------------------------------

If a file list displays a directory name that's identical to a
file name shown in the same list, the directory name has
precedence. For example, if you chose View to view a table, and
both a SAMPLE subdirectory (SAMPLE\) and SAMPLE table name appear
in the file list, choosing either item displays the contents of
the SAMPLE subdirectory in the file list.


11. Conditional Elements in SpeedBars
-------------------------------------

If the <String> argument of an element created by the SPEEDBAR
command is an empty string (""), the element won't appear on the
SpeedBar. You can use this to create conditional SpeedBar
elements. For example, the following code creates a SpeedBar that
only includes the F9 (Edit) element if the HasEditAccess variable
is set to True.

   SPEEDBAR "~F1~ Help"          : "F1",
            IIF(HasEditAccess,           ; Conditional element
                "~F9~ Edit","")  : "F9",
            "~F10~ Menu"         : "F10"


12. PAL Functions in the Watch Pane
-----------------------------------

Some PAL functions have normal but unexpected effects when
evaluated in the Debugger's Watch pane. Expressions in the Watch
pane recalculate whenever you Step or Trace through code, enter a
new expression or variable, or Suspend and restore the Debugger.
The following table lists some functions that perform an
operation whenever the Watch pane recalculates:

Function           Operation
---------------    ---------
GETCHAR()          Waits for a keystroke.

MATCH()            Creates and manipulates variables.

PRINTERSTATUS()    Looks for an active printer; if not found,
                   takes a few seconds before returning control
                   to the Debugger.

DRIVESTATUS()      Accesses the drive referred to in the
and DRIVESPACE()   function's argument.

ISTABLE(),         If a drive specifier is included, these have
ISFILE() and       the same effect as DRIVESTATUS()
DIREXISTS()        and DRIVESPACE().

SDIR()             Always returns the current directory.


13. Displaying Expression Values from the Miniscript Window
-----------------------------------------------------------

In earlier versions of Paradox, you could use RETURN <Expression>
to display the value of an expression using the Miniscript
command. In version 4.5, use MESSAGE <Expression> instead.


14. Documentation Revisions
---------------------------

This section of the README file contains new information and revisions
to the Paradox manuals.

Upgrade Guide
-------------
In Table 2.10 on page 60, the index name "AUTO-FILL" should be
"AUTO-FILLED".

On page 67, the following strings listed for WINDOWTYPE() will not be 
returned:

"RESTRUCTURE"
"INDEX"
"PASSWORD"
"SORT"

Getting Started
---------------
If you choose the Norwegian/Danish country group when you install
Paradox, the INSTALL program automatically copies NORDAN4.SOR to
PARADOX.SOR. NORDAN4.SOR is a modified version of the Paradox 3.5
NORDAN.SOR sort order file. If you have applications or databases that
depend on the old NORDAN.SOR sort order and don't want to use the new
NORDAN4.SOR sort order, you can copy NORDAN.SOR to PARADOX.SOR after
you install Paradox. See also the note on the SORTORDER() function in the
PAL Reference section of this file.

The Custom Configuration Program needs the following files to run:
CUSTOM.SC, CUSTOM.LIB, and CUSTOM.OV1. If any of these files are
missing, re-install Paradox to copy the files to your hard disk.

Blob Editor (in the PAL dialog box of CCP) lets you specify an external
BLOB editor to use for editing binary fields. Paradox doesn't include a
built-in BLOB editor.

User's Guide
------------
You cannot use Edit or DataEntry mode to modify a memo field in a linked
detail form; use CoEdit mode instead.

The IIF example preceding Example 8-3 should be:
IIF(ISBLANK([Miles]),"****",[Miles]).

Programmer's Guide
------------------
Under "Using Field Specifiers in Expressions," the fourth example should
be: [Orders->Quantity]=10.

The picture shown in Example 5-2 should be [(###) ]###-####. Omit any
additional spaces.

If a pushbutton has focus in a dialog box, it will be selected by
the Enter key regardless of where the DEFAULT keyword is used.
The example on page 244 implies that the CANCEL button will be
selected by the Enter key, as it is the default button. This is
only true if the button has focus. As the only elements in the
code example are pushbuttons, the CANCEL button must be declared
first to give it focus when the dialog box opens. For example

   PUSHBUTTON @5,23 WIDTH 10
      "~C~ancel"
      CANCEL
      DEFAULT
      VALUE "Cancel"
      TAG "No"
      TO ButtonValue
   PUSHBUTTON @5,8 WIDTH 10
      "~O~K"
      OK
      VALUE "Accept"
      TAG "Yes"
      TO ButtonValue

When nesting WAIT commands, you must nest each command within a
WAIT procedure. For example, to nest a WAIT FIELD within a WAIT
RECORD, you must place the WAIT FIELD command in the WAIT
procedure specified by the WAIT RECORD command.


PAL Reference
-------------
The behavior of the following PAL commands and functions differs from the
printed documentation.

- CONVERTLIB
  Convert all Paradox 3.5 library files to Paradox 4.5 format before using
  them. Some Paradox 3.5 library files might cause your system to hang if
  they are not converted before use in Paradox 4.5. See Chapter 1 of the
  "PAL Programmer's Guide" for information about converting PAL libraries.

  CONVERTLIB does not correctly convert a procedure that defines an
  embedded procedure.

- SETCOLORS
  The SETCOLORS command accepts the optional keyword DEFAULT to restore
  system colors to the settings used at the beginning of your Paradox
  session. The syntax is SETCOLORS DEFAULT.

- SETDIR
  The SETDIR command releases all locks placed by a user.

- SORTORDER()
  If you chose the Norwegian/Danish country group and its dictionary sort
  order at installation, the SORTORDER() function returns "nordan40". If
  you copy NORDAN.SOR to PARADOX.SOR, SORTORDER() returns "nordan". See the
  "Getting Started" section earlier in this file for further details.

- TABLEORDER()
  The new TABLEORDER() function returns the name of the secondary index
  that is ordering the current image of the active table (in table or
  form view). TABLEORDER() returns a null string ("") if the active table
  is unkeyed or is in primary index order (the default). TABLEORDER()
  results in an error if used in an inappropriate context, that is, in
  any context other than table or form view.

- UNDO
  The UNDO command does not restore changes from APPENDARRAY or
  REPLACEFIELDS.

Application Workshop
--------------------
The section "Screen" under the section "Order of execution for Report Print
items" in Chapter 12 of "Application Workshop" does not list the
execution order of Report Print objects when output is to the screen. The
screen output order is:

1) The Setup and Reset Strings, Printer Port, and End of Page options are
   overridden (if requested).

2) The Working message appears.

3) The setup procedure executes.

4) The report prints to the screen. The next keypress or mouse click
   removes the working message.

5) The cleanup procedure executes after "Cancel" is selected from the
   Report Previewer menu.

6) The Setup and Reset strings, Printer Port, and End of Page settings are
   restored.
