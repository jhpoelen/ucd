            INSTALLING PARADOX ON AN AT&T STARGROUP NETWORK
            -----------------------------------------------

This file contains instructions for installing Paradox on an AT&T StarGROUP
network. These instructions were verified using AT&T StarGROUP 3.5.1
on a Compaq DeskPro 386/25 computer using MS-DOS 5.0.

1. ASSUMPTIONS
--------------

These instructions assume the following about your StarGROUP installation:

- You use StarGROUP version 3.1 or higher. (NOTE: If you have a previous
  version, you need to use AD, FS, or PS in place of SRV in the following
  installation commands. Consult your StarGROUP version's documentation.)

- Your network has a shared applications directory named C:\\SERVERNAME\APPS,
  which is linked to each user's logical drive D and where SERVERNAME is
  the name of your server.

- You perform all installation and configuration operations from the
  server.

- The following parameters are set in the [LMXSERVER] section of LANMAN.INI
  at the server:

  IGNOREUNIX=YES
  UNIXLOCKS=NO
  USTRUCTS=2000

2. INSTALLATION STEPS
---------------------

1)  Create a sharename, PDOX45, that gives all users read-only rights to a
    subdirectory of \\SERVERNAME\APPS called PDOX45. The
    \\SERVERNAME\APPS\PDOX45 directory will contain the Paradox system
    files. By creating the sharename, you automatically create the
    subdirectory.

    a. From the server, log in as the network administrator. If you log in
       to the network from your local drive C, you can do this from your C>
       system prompt. Type

       SRV LOGIN \\SERVERNAME\ADMIN

    b. If a password is assigned to \\SERVERNAME\ADMIN, enter the
       password when prompted.

    c. Create the sharename that will give users read-only access to the
       PDOX45 directory (a subdirectory of \\SERVERNAME\APPS). Type

       SRV SHARE PDOX45=C:\APPS\PDOX45 /R

       where C: is the server physical drive containing the PDOX45 directory,
       and /R sets the rights to read-only.

2)  Create a sharename, PDOXADMN, for the PDOX45 system files directory for
    the network administrator that gives read/write/create rights. Type

    SRV SHARE PDOXADMN=C:\APPS\PDOX45/PASS=Password /RWC

    where "Password" is the password you assign, and /RWC stands for
    read/write/create rights. Write down the password and store it in
    a safe location for future reference.

3)  Create a sharename that gives all users read/write/create rights to a
    first-level directory, PDOXDATA. The \\SERVERNAME\PDOXDATA directory
    will contain shared Paradox data files and the network control file
    PDOXUSRS.NET. By creating the sharename, you automatically create the
    directory.

    If you have more than one server, or if your server has more than one
    hard disk, your choice of which server disk drive to use for the
    PDOXDATA directory should depend on how heavily Paradox will be used.
    Estimate the probable growth of your shared data and pick a drive with
    enough available storage space.

    As your network users become familiar with Paradox, they will probably
    create new Paradox tables and applications. When in doubt, overestimate
    the amount of space you'll need.

    NOTE: If your network already has a shared data directory and an
    associated sharename, you can use them for shared Paradox tables;
    however, this isn't recommended, because mixing Paradox data
    with other application data in the same directory makes network
    housekeeping more difficult. If you do decide to put Paradox data in an
    existing shared data directory with other applications' shared data, skip
    this step.

    To set up the PDOXDATA sharename and directory, type

    SRV SHARE PDOXDATA=X:\PDOXDATA /RWC

    where X is any server logical drive letter, and PDOXDATA is a valid DOS
    path on that drive to a new directory, PDOXDATA.

    NOTE: Don't assign a password to this directory, because users would
    have to enter the password every time they wanted to access shared data
    in PDOXDATA. You can password-protect individual tables and applications
    in this directory; see "Protect" in Chapter 17 of the Paradox
    "User's Guide."

4)  Log in to the network as a client and establish the following links:

    a. Link logical drive E to your network home directory. Type

       SRV LINK E:

    b. Link logical drive F to the PDOXDATA directory. Type

       SRV LINK \\SERVERNAME\PDOXDATA F:

    c. Link logical drive G to the PDOX45 directory. Type

       SRV LINK \\SERVERNAME\PDOXADMN G:

       Because you're using the PDOXADMN sharename, you have
       read/write/create rights.

5)  Install the Paradox system files and optional software. Follow the
    instructions in NETWORK.TXT (found on your Paradox installation disks).
    The Paradox INSTALL program copies your Paradox system files and optional
    software from the program disks into the system files directory, PDOX45.

6)  Create and modify the CONFIG.SYS file of each workstation to set the
    number of buffers and files needed by Paradox:

    FILES=40
    BUFFERS=40

    A workstation's CONFIG.SYS file must be stored in the root directory of
    the workstation's hard disk (or on the boot disk if the workstation is
    started from a floppy disk). See NETWORK.TXT for details on CONFIG.SYS.

    NOTE: After editing the CONFIG.SYS file, you must reboot the workstation
    before you can run Paradox. To reboot, press [Ctrl][Alt][Del].

7)  Edit the [ATTISO_XIF] session of the PROTOCOL.INI at the workstation:

    NSESS=10

    NOTE: After editing the PROTOCOL.INI you must restart the network
    session.
 
8)  Link each user to a private directory. The private directory must be
    either a network home directory or a private directory on a local hard
    disk. For information, see "Linking Users and Setting User Paths"
    later in this file. For information about private directories, see
    NETWORK.TXT.

9)  Link each user to the Paradox system files directory, PDOX45.
    For information, see "Linking Users and Setting User Paths"
    later in this file.

10) Link each user to the directory containing PDOXUSRS.NET, PDOXDATA.
    For information, see "Linking Users and Setting User Paths"
    later in this file.

11) Change each Paradox user's path to search for the user's private
    directory and the Paradox system files directory, IN THAT ORDER. The
    user's private directory must precede all other Paradox-related
    directories in the path, since Paradox searches for PARADOX.CFG in the
    private directory to determine the user's private directory and other
    default settings. For information, see "Linking Users and Setting
    User Paths" later in this file. For information about the PARADOX.CFG
    file, see NETWORK.TXT.

12) Create PARADOX.CFG files. See NETWORK.TXT for complete details.


3. LINKING USERS AND SETTING USER PATHS
---------------------------------------

You can establish the links and paths for each workstation (steps 7, 8, 9,
and 10) in different ways. In theory, network users can enter them manually
from their keyboards when they want to use Paradox, but this isn't
recommended, because a mistake could cause serious problems for network
Paradox users. You should automatically create the correct links and path
for each user instead. You can use two methods:

- A login batch file that automatically sets up every user to run Paradox
  when he or she logs in to the network. This method is good for networks
  where Paradox is used frequently.

- A Paradox batch file that sets up the correct links and path when a user
  starts Paradox. Use this method for networks where Paradox is used
  infrequently.

To use a login batch file
-------------------------
On most AT&T StarGROUP networks, each user has an individual batch file (or
series of batch files) that logs the user in to the network. The login batch
file method uses these batch files to establish the links and paths for
Paradox use.

The way you structure your login batch commands depends on your network. For
example, on a network using the three-drive pattern of drive assignments,
include the following lines in a login batch file after the line in the batch
sequence that logs the user into StarGROUP:

SRV LINK D: \\SERVERNAME\APPS
SRV LINK F: \\SERVERNAME\PDOXDATA
SRV LINK E:
PATH = C:\PDOX45; D:\PDOX45; D:\

To use a Paradox batch file
---------------------------
Instead of linking to the Paradox directories in a user's login batch file
and including the Paradox directories in each user's path, you can create a
special Paradox batch file that establishes the correct links and sets the
correct path each time Paradox is started.

Store this batch file in a directory already on everyone's search path, such
as the shared applications directory. Since everyone who uses Paradox will
run the same Paradox batch file, write the path so that Paradox finds the
correct PARADOX.CFG file for each user.

The following sample Paradox batch file makes these assumptions:

- The network uses the four-drive pattern of drive assignments.

- Everyone who uses it is already logged in to the network, and everyone's
  network home directory is already linked to logical drive E.

- All workstations have local hard disks, and each workstation has a
  C:\PDOX45 directory to be used as a private directory.

- The shared applications directory \\SERVERNAME\APPS is already linked to
  each user's logical drive D.

Give the batch file an appropriate name, such as PDOX.BAT, and store it in
the shared applications directory \\SERVERNAME\APPS.

Here is the batch file. (If your network doesn't conform to the previous
assumptions, you might need to modify it.)

PATH>E:\SAVEPATH.BAT
SRV LINK F: \\SERVERNAME\PDOXDATA
SRV LINK G: \\SERVERNAME\PDOX45
PATH = C:\PDOX45; G:\; D:\
PARADOX
SRV UNLINK F:
SRV UNLINK G:
COMMAND /C E:\SAVEPATH
DEL E:\SAVEPATH.BAT

Here are descriptions of the individual lines:

- The first line saves the user's current path for later restoration.

- The second line links the user's logical drive F to the Paradox shared data
  directory (containing PDOXUSRS.NET) using the sharename PDOXDATA. What you
  enter here must match the PDOXUSRS.NET location you entered when you
  installed Paradox.

- The third line links the user's logical drive G to the Paradox system files
  directory using the sharename PDOX45.

- The fourth line sets the correct path so that the private directory on the
  local hard disk is searched first to find the correct PARADOX.CFG file.
  This example PATH statment includes D:\ so the user has access to the
  AT&T StarGROUP network software and network batch files.

  NOTE: If some workstations on the network don't have hard disks, their
  users must use their network home directory as their private directory
  (containing a PARADOX.CFG file). In this case, the fourth line would be

  PATH = E:\; G:\; D:\

  With this path, Paradox looks for the PARADOX.CFG file in the user's
  network home directory, E:.

- The fifth line starts Paradox.

- The sixth and seventh lines are invoked when the user exits from Paradox;
  they unlink the PDOXDATA and the PDOX45 directories, respectively.

- The eighth line restores the user's original path by running the
  SAVEPATH.BAT batch file.

- The ninth line deletes the SAVEPATH.BAT batch file.
